    <h3> Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Greetings! 
        My name is Tahiba Rahman and I'm a sophomore at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in
        Software Engineering trying to change my career path. I was born in Bangladesh and wasn't fluent in English. It's been a rough journey especially from adjusting my life
        to fit into another culture. I went through many dark times and there were many times I wished to give up on life. However, 
        I stayed persistent and found myself trying to overcome my hardships. In the end, I managed to get the highest scholarship
        and enroll in a private university. I'm grateful for the opportunties I received in life to improve myself.
